**A article I wrote to convince my group members to use Python for project rather than Java. So we can finish the project faster. 

<code lang="python">print "Let's Python!""</code>
<!--more-->
<p>Python is easy and time-saving. It will require much less time to develop a software than using Java. In fact, a lot of start-up companies use Python. </p>
Some good study resource:</br>http://www.sthurlow.com/python</br>http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/<br/>
<p>Python GUI:
There are lot of API out there. Using the standard <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/" title="Tkinter">Tkinter</a> is good enough for a small project.</p>

**Remember, there are Python2.7 and Python3. We will use Python2.7.
2.7 has been around for a while. It is stable and has a lot of open-source API available.

Developing Environment:
Text editor + python run time.
I recommend use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text2</a> for editing Python. It is not free, but the trial time is unlimited.
If you are using Mac, it comes with Mac. You are ready to go.
If you are using Windows, go to official site and download python2.7.

For IDE addicted, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> is fairly nice, only costs $29 for students.

Python trick:
When you want to look up the API document of certain module, instead of googling, you can do it offline.<li> in shell, type "<strong>pydoc(module_name)</strong>". It prints out all the detail of the module</li>
<li>in python interative shell, type <strong>help(anything_you_wondering)</strong>. e,g help(list).</li>


How to install third-party API:
BeautifulSoup, a common-used XML API on python. In shell, <strong>"sudo easy_install beautifulSoup"</strong> will download and install everything for you.

You can use python interactive shell as a small calculator.
Beside + - * / % **, you can also  "<strong>from math import *</strong>" to use sin(), cos(), sqrt().

You can also check my Github page and get a sense of Python</br>https://github.com/juh42</br>https://gist.github.com/juh42

**By the way, Github is one of the most popular code collaboration website based on Git. Please register and give a try. It has enough configuration management features. lots of famous project using it. e,g JQuery. Please check <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2011/08/16/githubs-50-most-popular-projects">this</a>

One last thing, Python and Github can make your resume more attractive to HR :)
