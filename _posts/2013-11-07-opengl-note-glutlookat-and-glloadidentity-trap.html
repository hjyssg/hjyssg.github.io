A tricky bug of my openGl project. Considering following code:
<!--more-->
[code lang="c"]
glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
gluPerspective(fovy, aspect, near, far); 
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)
gluLookAt(posX, posY, posZ,
          lookAtX, lookAtY, lookAtZ, 
          upX, upY, upZ);
draw_object_a();
glPushMatrix();
glLoadIdentity();
draw_object_b();
glPopMatrix();
[/code]
<p>Object A will render normal, while Object B will not, Why?</p>
<p>glutLookAt and glLoadIdentity both apply matrix transformation on the top matrix of modelView stack.After glLookAt called, the camera transformation is applied to matrix. But glLoadIdentity will simply replace it with a identity matrix. </p>
<p>So B will render without camera transformation, A will. </p>
<p>**Note B will still render with perspective transformation since projection matrix wasn't touched by glLoadIdentity</p>
