This is a small memo about how to use vim.


1. The easiest way set up vim is to use other people's configuration.
For example, [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) is very good and you should take  a look.

1. For Mac, install iterm2. The defualt terminal does not work very well with vim. To use the mouse, insert 'set mouse=a' in ".vimrs". 
 
1. In vim, select text using mouse while pressing option key, then you can copy by CMD + C  

1. format all code: gg = G

1. search / and stop searching :noh  

1. replace 0, $ s/a/b/gci

1. tab can be used to autocomplete command

1. useful pulgin:  tag_list, TlistOpen, NERDTree, MRU, conque 

1. enter shell  ":shell"
